"""Distill the rule-based Speed Safety Score into a RandomForestRegressor.

speed_safety_score is a deterministic function of the six FEATURE_COLUMNS
below (see score.calculate_score), so this isn't learning anything the
formula didn't already encode. It's a sanity check that (a) a learned model
recovers the same weighting the Safe System formula uses -- compare
model.feature_importances_ to score.BASE_WEIGHTS in evaluate() -- and (b)
the train/eval plumbing works end to end, ready to point at a real
supervised target (e.g. per-segment crash/fatality data) the moment one
exists. See README.md "Future enhancements" for that gap: the crash data
available so far (ATO Road Safety workbook) is national-level only, one
row per country per year, so it can't be joined to individual segments as
a label without every segment in a country collapsing to the same value.
