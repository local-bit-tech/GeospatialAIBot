"""SCAFFOLD ONLY -- intentionally not executed by the automated pipeline.

The Speed Safety Score in score.py is a deterministic, hand-weighted formula,
not a trained model. This file is a starting point if/when the team wants to
fit an actual predictive model (e.g. to learn feature weights from outcome
data, or to validate the rule-based score against an external target such as
RankedPercentile or real crash records). Nothing here is run as part of
notebooks/scripts in this repo -- fill in a real target and run it yourselves.

Suggested next steps, left undone on purpose:
  1. Decide the supervised target (RankedPercentile? observed crash/fatality
     data, if it becomes available? a hand-labelled subset?).
  2. Choose train/test split strategy -- likely by country and/or road class
     to avoid leakage between geographically adjacent segments.
  3. Try a baseline (e.g. RandomForestRegressor) against the engineered
     features in segments_scored.geojson, and compare its ranking of
     segments to the rule-based speed_safety_score.
  4. Validate carefully before trusting it over the transparent rule-based
     score -- the Safe System weighting is the explainable baseline this
     challenge submission relies on.
