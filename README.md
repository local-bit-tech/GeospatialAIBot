# AI for Safer Roads — Speed Safety Score

Submission for the **ADB AI for Safer Roads Innovation Challenge 2026**.

## What this does

Posted speed limits don't always match what's safe for the people actually
using a road — pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists in particular. This
project scores ~70,000 road segments across **India (Maharashtra)** and
**Thailand** on how far their posted speed limit is misaligned with Safe
System principles and vulnerable road user (VRU) exposure, combining:

- **How much faster traffic actually drives** than the posted limit (85th
  percentile speed vs. limit).
- **Whether the posted limit itself exceeds Safe System guidance** for that
  road's class (e.g. a 90 km/h limit on a 60 km/h-max secondary road).
- **The likely consequence of a crash at that speed** for an unprotected
  road user (a standard pedestrian fatality-risk curve).
- **How exposed vulnerable road users are** on that segment (urban
  context plus regional helmet-wearing data, as a proxy for two-wheeler
  vulnerability).

The result is a 0–100 **Speed Safety Score** per segment, a High/Medium/Low
risk tier, and an interactive map you can explore segment by segment —
including a one-click link to street-level imagery for context.

This is a transparent, hand-weighted scoring formula, not a trained
predictive model — every score is traceable back to the four inputs above.
See `docs/methodology.md` for the full reasoning, the data-quality issues
found along the way, and an honest discussion of where the score's
validation came back weaker than expected.

## Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai4saferroads
```

Place the raw GeoJSON exports in `data/raw/` before running anything (not
committed to this repo — see `.gitignore`):

- `data/raw/ADB_Innovation_Maharashtra.geojson`
- `data/raw/ADB_Innovation_Thailand.geojson`

The VRU exposure feature also expects the helmet-wearing survey GeoPackages
under `Archive/` (see Data sources below).

## How to run

Run the notebooks **in order** from the `notebooks/` directory:

1. **`01_data_exploration.ipynb`** — loads both raw files, profiles schemas
   and nulls, checks the segment-ID relationship between the two countries,
   plots sample-size and speed-gap distributions, flags known data
   anomalies.
2. **`02_cleaning_and_features.ipynb`** — filters to reliable segments,
   saves `data/processed/segments_reliable.geojson` and
   `segments_low_confidence.geojson`, builds every score feature.
3. **`03_scoring_and_sensitivity.ipynb`** — computes the Speed Safety Score
   and risk tiers, validates against `RankedPercentile`, runs the ±10%
   weight sensitivity analysis.
4. **`04_exports_and_map.ipynb`** — exports `outputs/segments_scored.geojson`
   / `.gpkg` / `summary_statistics.csv`, and builds the interactive map.

Each notebook hands off intermediate state to the next via small cache files
in `data/processed/` (gitignored, regenerated each run). The reusable logic
itself lives in `src/` (`utils.py`, `features.py`, `score.py`), which the
notebooks import rather than duplicating.
