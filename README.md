# AI for Safer Roads — Speed Safety Score

Submission for the **AI for Safer Roads Innovation Challenge**, organized by:

- Asian Development Bank (ADB)
- World Bank Development Impact Group
- AI for Good
- International Telecommunication Union (ITU)

**Challenge statement:** How might we use AI and mobility data to determine
where speed limits are misaligned with real-world road conditions,
supporting evidence-based speed management across Asia and the Pacific?

## What this does

Posted speed limits don't always match what's safe for the people actually
using a road — pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists in particular, and
they often become outdated as the surrounding environment changes. Rather
than detecting speeding behaviour, this project asks a different question:
**is the posted speed limit itself appropriate** for each road segment?

It scores ~70,000 road segments across **India (Maharashtra)** and
**Thailand** on how far their posted speed limit is misaligned with Safe
System principles and vulnerable road user (VRU) exposure, combining:

- **How much faster traffic actually drives** than the posted limit (85th
  percentile speed vs. limit).
- **Whether the posted limit itself exceeds Safe System guidance** for that
  road's class (e.g. a 90 km/h limit on a 60 km/h-max secondary road).
- **The likely consequence of a crash at that speed** for an unprotected
  road user (a standard pedestrian fatality-risk curve).
- **How exposed vulnerable road users are** on that segment (urban
  context plus regional helmet-wearing data, as a proxy for two-wheeler
  vulnerability).

The result is a 0–100 **Speed Safety Score** per segment, a High/Medium/Low
risk tier, and an interactive map you can explore segment by segment —
including a one-click link to street-level imagery for context — surfacing
candidate roads for speed limit review by policymakers.

This is a transparent, hand-weighted scoring formula, not a trained
predictive model — every score is traceable back to the four inputs above.
See `docs/methodology.md` for the full reasoning, the data-quality issues
found along the way, and an honest discussion of where the score's
validation came back weaker than expected.

**Interactive map:** https://augustin-birladeanu.github.io/GeospatialAIBot/
*(requires GitHub Pages enabled on this repo, pointing at `/docs`)*

## Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai4saferroads
```

Place the raw GeoJSON exports in `data/raw/` before running anything (not
committed to this repo — see `.gitignore`):

- `data/raw/ADB_Innovation_Maharashtra.geojson`
- `data/raw/ADB_Innovation_Thailand.geojson`

The VRU exposure feature also expects the helmet-wearing survey GeoPackages
under `Archive/` (see Data sources below).

## How to run

Run the notebooks **in order** from the `notebooks/` directory:

1. **`01_data_exploration.ipynb`** — loads both raw files, profiles schemas
   and nulls, checks the segment-ID relationship between the two countries,
   plots sample-size and speed-gap distributions, flags known data
   anomalies.
2. **`02_cleaning_and_features.ipynb`** — filters to reliable segments,
   saves `data/processed/segments_reliable.geojson` and
   `segments_low_confidence.geojson`, builds every score feature.
3. **`03_scoring_and_sensitivity.ipynb`** — computes the Speed Safety Score
   and risk tiers, validates against `RankedPercentile`, runs the ±10%
   weight sensitivity analysis.
4. **`04_exports_and_map.ipynb`** — exports `outputs/segments_scored.geojson`
   / `.gpkg` / `summary_statistics.csv`, and builds the interactive map.

Each notebook hands off intermediate state to the next via small cache files
in `data/processed/` (gitignored, regenerated each run). The reusable logic
itself lives in `src/` (`utils.py`, `features.py`, `score.py`), which the
notebooks import rather than duplicating.

  (Global Rural Urban Mapping Project), and the `UrbanPC` field for India.
- **Helmet-wearing / motorcycle exposure**: regional survey results provided
  in `Archive/*.gpkg` (Boundaries_4helmet for Maharashtra,
  Thailand_Province_Boundaries for Thailand), used as a VRU exposure proxy.

  per segment via `mapillary_url`.

  sources"*, Richard Owen / Agilysis, May 2026 (PDF included in this repo).

Some datasets referenced in early planning (population density, school/market
proximity) are available only through the competition under NDA and are not
yet integrated — see Future Enhancements below.

Full methodology, including how the two countries' differing data schemas
were reconciled and a discussion of the validation results: see
**[`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md)**.

## Status

Implemented: schema-harmonized loading for both countries, the reliability
filter, all six engineered features, the weighted Speed Safety Score and
risk tiers, sensitivity analysis, GeoJSON/GeoPackage/CSV exports, and the
interactive map. Not implemented (see `src/train_model.py` for a scaffold):
a trained predictive model — the current score is a transparent rule-based
formula, by design, not a model fit to outcome data.

## Future enhancements

- Population density, school proximity, and market proximity layers (once
  available) to sharpen the `vru_exposure` feature beyond the current
  urban-flag + helmet-wearing proxy.
- A trained model validated against real outcome data (crash/fatality
  records), rather than the current rule-based score.
- Cross-country model transfer to additional Asia-Pacific countries.
- An interactive web dashboard beyond the static Folium map.
